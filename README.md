### How It Works
The Tinder for Food application presents users with a series of mouthwatering dishes, one at a time, displayed as cards on the screen. Users can interact with each dish card through swiping gestures to express their preference. Here's how it works:

1. **Swipe Right to Like:** If a user likes a particular dish, they can simply swipe the card to the right, indicating their interest in the dish.

2. **Swipe Left to Dislike:** Conversely, if a dish doesn't appeal to the user's taste, they can swipe the card to the left, dismissing the dish.

3. **View Dish Details:** Users can tap on a dish card to view more details about the dish, including its image, location, price, description, rating, and a list of its key ingredients.

4. **Google Maps Integration:** The application also features a "View on Google Maps" button, allowing users to quickly locate the restaurant or place associated with the dish.

### Project Features
The project incorporates several features to enhance the user experience:

1. Dynamic Content: Dish cards are dynamically generated from a predefined list of dishes, each containing relevant information.

2. Price Indicator: The price of each dish is visually represented with dollar signs, making it easier for users to identify the approximate cost.

3. Ingredient List: Users can access the list of ingredients for each dish, providing insights into the dish's preparation.

4. Swipe Animation: Swiping gestures trigger smooth animations, adding a touch of excitement to the overall interaction.

### Technologies Used
The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It utilizes touch and mouse event listeners to handle swiping interactions. The Google Maps API integration provides location details for each dish.
